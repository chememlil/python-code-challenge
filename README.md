Python Coding Assessment
Purpose:
This repository contains Python code implementing various functions, demonstrating different Python concepts.

Functions:

add_numbers(num1, num2): Adds two numbers.
is_even(number): Checks if a number is even.
reverse_string(text): Reverses a string.
count_vowels(text): Counts vowels in a string.
calculate_factorial(n): Calculates the factorial of a number.
apply_decorator(func): Applies a decorator to a function.
sort_by_age(list_of_tuples): Sorts a list of tuples by age.
merge_dicts(dict1, dict2): Merges two dictionaries.
Car class: Represents a car with make, model, and year attributes.
Usage:

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone <https://github.com/chememlil/python-code-challenge>
Use code with caution.

Run the Python script:
Bash
python <main>.py
Use code with caution.

Replace <main.py> with the actual name of your Python script.
Examples:

Python
# Testing add_numbers
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

# Testing is_even
is_even_result = is_even(4)
print(is_even_result)  # Output: True

# Testing reverse_string
reversed_text = reverse_string("hello")
print(reversed_text)  # Output: "olleh"

# ... (other examples)
Use code with caution.

Note:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Adjust the repository URL and script name accordingly.
Replace the placeholder comments with your actual code.
Additional Information:

Feel free to modify and expand upon the functions and classes to explore different Python concepts.
Consider adding more test cases to ensure the code's correctness.
Explore other Python libraries and modules to enhance your programming capabilities.
